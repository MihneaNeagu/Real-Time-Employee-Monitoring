Real-Time Employee Monitoring System

Description

The Real-Time Employee Monitoring System is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate efficient task management and real-time tracking of employee activities. It consists of three main components: a boss view, an employee view, and a login system, each with a dedicated user interface. Bosses can assign tasks, monitor progress, and manage employee activity, while employees can view their tasks and update their status.

Features

Boss View: Assign tasks, view logged-in employees, update or remove tasks, and view detailed task descriptions.

Employee View: Display tasks assigned to the employee, mark tasks as done, and log out.

Login System: Secure login for both employees and bosses, with authentication and session management.
